2. Process customer record
A program is required to read a customer’s name, a purchase amount and a tax code. 
The tax code has been validated and will be one of the following:
    0  tax exempt (0%)
    1  state sales tax only (3%)
    2  federal and state sales tax (5%)
    3  special sales tax (7%)
The program must then compute the sales tax and the total amount due,and print the customer’s name, purchase amount, sales tax and total amount due.

	customer_name
	purchase_ammount

else if tax_code =0 then
	tax_code_percent =0
else
	Print "invalid tax code"
	
tax = (purchase_ammount * tax_code_percent)/100
total_ammount_due = purchase_ammount + tax
print "customer_name: " customer_name
