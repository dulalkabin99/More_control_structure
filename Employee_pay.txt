3. Calculate employee's pay
A program is required by a company to read an employee’s number, pay rate and the number of hours worked in a week. The program is then to validate the pay rate field and the hours worked field and, if valid, compute the employee’s weekly pay and then print it and the input data.

Validation: According to the company’s rules, the maximum hours an employee can work per week is 60 hours, and the maximum hourly rate is $25.00 per hour. If the hours worked field or the hourly rate field is out of range, the input data and an appropriate message are to be printed and the employee’s weekly pay is not to be calculated.

Weekly pay calculation: Weekly pay is calculated as hours worked times pay rate. If more than 35 hours are worked, payment for the overtime hours worked is calculated at time-and-a-half.

Inputs
employee_number
pay_rate
hours_worked

	
Process
	get pay_rate, hours_rate
	
	if hours_worked > 60 then
	print "Employee can not work more tyhan 60 hrs"
	else if pay_rate > 25 then
	print "Pay rate is too High"
	else if hours_worked >35
	overtime = hours_worked - 35
	regular_hours = 35
	total_pay = (regular_hours * pay_rate) + (overtime *pay_rate * 1.5)
	else
	total_pay = hours_worked * pay_rate

	
	
	
 
Output
Print total_pay
